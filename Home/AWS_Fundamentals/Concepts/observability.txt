What is Infrastructure as Code?	[[https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/fundamentals-core-concepts/|[ref 1]]]
* Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing your infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files.
* IaC is the foundation that allows for the automation of your infrastructure.
* Instead of manually provisioning services, you create templates that describe the resources that you want.
* The IaC platform then takes care of provisioning and configuring the resources on your behalf.
* IaC gives you a declarative and automated way of provisioning infrastructure.
* It allows you to apply the same tool (e.g., git) and processes (e.g., code review) for your infrastructure as you already do for your code.
* IaC on AWS has traditionally been implemented using [[+CloudFormation]] service.
* CloudFormation requires declaring your resources using [[+JSON]] or [[+YAML]] .
* If these configuration languages aren't your cup of tea, the AWS provides the [[+Cloud_Development_Kit]] (CDK) which allows you to author CloudFormation templates using native programming languages like [[+JavaScript]] , [[+Python]] , and [[+Java]] .

* IaC is the process of managing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files.
* IaC is a [[+declarative]] and automated way of provisioning infrastucture.
* You can apply the same tools and processes to your infrastructure as you do to your code.
* Use services like CloudFOrmation and DCK to implement IaC on AWS.
