What is abstraction?
In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is:
* the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance; it is similar in nature to the process of [[+generalization]];
* the creation of abstract concept-objects by mirroring common features or attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study - the result of the process of abstraction.
